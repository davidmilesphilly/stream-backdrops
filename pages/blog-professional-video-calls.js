                Working from home has made video calls a cornerstone of professional communication. Whether you're meeting with clients, presenting to your team, or interviewing for your dream job, your video presence matters more than ever.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Perfect Your Lighting Setup</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Good lighting can make or break your video call appearance. Position yourself facing a window or invest in a simple ring light. Avoid having bright lights behind you, which will turn you into a silhouette.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Quick tip:</strong> The light source should be in front of you, not behind you.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Choose the Right Background</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Your background should be professional but not distracting. A cluttered or inappropriate background can take attention away from what you're saying. Consider using virtual backgrounds if your actual space isn't ideal.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Popular professional background choices include:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <li>Clean home office setups</li>
                <li>Neutral walls with minimal decoration</li>
                <li>Library or bookshelf backgrounds</li>
                <li>Modern office environments</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Position Your Camera at Eye Level</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Nobody wants to look up your nose during a meeting. Position your camera at eye level to create a natural, confident appearance. Use books or a laptop stand to adjust your camera height.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Test Your Audio Quality</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Poor audio is more distracting than poor video. Use a dedicated microphone or headset when possible, and always test your audio before important calls.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Dress Appropriately</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Dress as you would for an in-person meeting. Even if only your upper body is visible, wearing professional attire helps you feel more confident and puts you in the right mindset.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Minimize Distractions</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <li>Close unnecessary applications</li>
                <li>Put your phone on silent</li>
                <li>Let family members know you're in a meeting</li>
                <li>Have water nearby to avoid mid-call interruptions</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Make Eye Contact with the Camera</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Look at your camera lens, not your screen, when speaking. This creates the impression of eye contact with other participants.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">8. Use Gestures Purposefully</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Keep your gestures within the camera frame and use them naturally to emphasize points. Avoid excessive movement that can be distracting.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">9. Have a Backup Plan</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Technical issues happen. Know how to:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <li>Dial in via phone if your internet fails</li>
                <li>Use mobile data as a backup</li>
                <li>Quickly restart your application if needed</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">10. Practice Good Video Call Etiquette</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <li>Join meetings on time</li>
                <li>Mute yourself when not speaking</li>
                <li>Use chat features appropriately</li>
                <li>End calls gracefully</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
